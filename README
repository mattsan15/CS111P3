Additional Information
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Header file was causing multiple compiling inconvinences, so in our implementation of the source code we opted to use the
http://www.nongnu.org/ext2-doc/ext2.html explanation of an EXT2 file system to extract byte offsets and did not incoorperate the
header file in our solution.
